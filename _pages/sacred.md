## Sacred Music

>“Music is the language of the spirit. It opens the secret of life bringing peace, abolishing strife.”  
> -- Khalil Gibran

What is 'sacred'? Sacred is something that is worthy of spiritual respect. And here we mean a set of themes or ideas that transcend any particular religious school of thought and are universal in nature. Ideas on love, passion, pain, hope, work, loneliness and many more that occur repeatedly in different spiritual poems or writings. We will take creative inspiration from Gibran, Kabir, Faiz, Rumi and many more to come to understand sacred ideas. You can see a selection of inspiration passages and poems here - [Sacred Music inspiration](pdf/sacred_music.pdf)

The broad idea is to bring together a set of musicians interested in 'Sacred' to create a performance as well as an album. This will be done as an extension of the ['Shoonya' band](http://shoonya.jembeashok.com). Once the music is ready, we can plan for a set of public performance to share this with the world.

The intention is to have a small set of musician - about five or six , coming together and playing acoustic music inspired by such sacred themes. We are looking to collaborate with additional experienced musicians across the spectrum who can play the following instruments.

- *Wind*: Indian Flute, or any other wind instrument
- *Strings*: Guitar, Violin, or Sarangi
- *Vocals*: Preferably classical music background

Looking forward to this collaboration.
