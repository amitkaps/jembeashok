## Music

My musical journey began with the tabla and found fulfilment in the Jembe - an African drum. I am a true fusion musician, having played with Carnatic, Hindustani and even dabbled with electronica. In a fusion of the arts, I have even played for artist, BKS Varma who painted during my jembe recital. The Attakalari Centre for Movement Arts have used my skills in the arena of dance. I have also composed music for several plays including an India – Hong Kong production called 'Yours Most Obediently'. I am now working with my dream project – Shoonya.

### Shoonya - A World Fusion Band

The Sanskrit word Shoonya translates to “Nothingness” - the Indian concept of how everything comes into being from nothingness. This ancient Indian concept could not be truer for music. Shoonya the band takes inspiration from their “nothingness” to create some of the most eclectic and genre defying music.

The language of music has seen many diverse and successful experiments to blend the various styles of world music. Shoonya seeks to create their own dialect, culled from influences that range from folk music, Carnatic and Hindustani music to West African rhythms. The varied set of artistes from Shoonya aim to break cultural, social and ethnical frontiers to create a community experience for a diverse audience.

Shoonya is a collaborative platform for people from various artistic backgrounds to introduce their musical ideas into the mix, and have at some point worked with art forms ranging from theatre and dance to electronic music. Beyond their genre defying experiments in contemporary music, Shoonya attempt to address a most basic and necessary function – conveying to the listener the pure joy of music.
