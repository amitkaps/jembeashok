## Sacred Music Project

The broad idea at the moment is to bring together a set of musicians interested in 'Sacred Music' to create a performance as well as an album on this topic. The intention is to have a small set of musician - about four or five, playing the Percussion (Djembe, Tabla, Daruka), Duduk (Armenian Double Reed Flute), Indian Flute, Guitar and Vocals to create this music. Once the music is ready, we can plan for a set of public performance to share this with the world.
