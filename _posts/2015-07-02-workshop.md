## Coaching & Training

### Acting Coach & Theatre Workshops

I conduct theatre workshop for new and upcoming actors, as well as corporates

I have extensively used theatre in the field of education and have presented a much appreciated paper on Social Development through theatre. My varied experiments in using theatre as a method of learning got him invited to Mahtomedi Public School, Minneapolis, where I designed and executed a theatre workshop on the theme 'Beyond the Borders' in 2003-4\. Theatre and music were used to assist young people address social, cultural and personal concerns. I presented a paper on Creative Use of Drama and Music in Educations. The Ministry of Human Resource Development awarded me a scolarship for this work.

### Film Acting Workshop

This workshop is my humble effort to share 20 years of my acting experience across theatre, film and television. This course is designed for upcoming actors who have some acting experience in these mediums and feel the need to further develop their skills. This will be held as an intensive workshop of about 15 sessions of 3 hours each, across two weeks. The number of actors will be restricted to 15 to ensure personalised attention can be provided. This will give each actor an opportunity to work on their specific areas of focus and improvement e.g. body language, voice and modulation, effective dialogue delivery etc.

### Jembe Workshop

Music (djembe) is about discovery – finding our own rhythm when we are alone or when we are part of a group. I conduct jembe workshops like drum circles for corporates in small group settings. Some of the recent corporate clients have been ARM, Oracle, Cyient etc.. These workshops are designed to use rhythm and music as a medium for team building and leadership skills. They can be structured as either a half day session or a full day session. Some activites conducted in the workshop are listed below.

### Utsmaya - Storytelling, Jembe & Theatre

I have co-developed (with [Amit](http://amitkaps.com)) this unique workshop experience to enable anyone to flourish. We believe each of us have a seed in us that if provided the right nourishment and support can flower in its own unique way. We don’t need to follow any traditional path or fit ourselves into a framework of how everyone works. We use three lenses - three different art forms of Roleplay (Theatre), Storytelling and Jembe (Music) - to get started on this journey. Each art form is used in a session as the chosen medium for expression, exploration and discovery.
