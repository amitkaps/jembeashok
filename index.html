    <h3> Shoonya </h3>
    <p>The Sanskrit word Shoonya translates to “Nothingness” - the Indian concept of how everything comes into being from nothingness. This ancient Indian concept could not be truer for music. Shoonya the band takes inspiration from their “nothingness” to create some of the most eclectic and genre defying music. </p>

    <p>The language of music has seen many diverse and successful experiments to blend the various styles of world music. Shoonya seeks to create their own dialect, culled from influences that range from folk music, Carnatic and Hindustani music to West African rhythms. The varied set of artistes from Shoonya aim to break cultural, social and ethnical frontiers to create a community experience for a diverse audience. </p>

    <p>Shoonya describe themselves as a collaborative platform for people from various artistic backgrounds to introduce their musical ideas into the mix, and have at some point worked with art forms ranging from theatre and dance to electronic music. Beyond their genre defying experiments in contemporary music, Shoonya attempt to address a most basic and necessary function – conveying to the listener the pure joy of music. </p>
