  role: This unique workshop experience is to enable anyone to flourish. I believe each of us have a seed in us that if provided the right nourishment and support can flower in its own unique way. In this workshop, we use three lenses - three different art forms of Roleplay (Theatre), Storytelling and Jembe (Music) - to get started on this journey. Each art form is used in a session as the chosen medium for expression, exploration and discovery.
