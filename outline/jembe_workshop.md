# Jembe Workshop

Music (djembe) is about discovery – finding our own rhythm when we are alone or when we are part of a group. I conduct jembe workshops for corporates, NGO and education institutes in small group settings. Some of the recent corporate clients have been ARM, Oracle, Cyient etc.. These workshops are designed to use rhythm and music as a medium for team building and leadership skills. They can be structured as either a half day session or a full day session. Some activites conducted in the workshop are listed below.

* **Start with Rhythm** - Clap, speak, walk but do that all in a rhythm
* **Drum it Up** - Introduce the drums and play with some simple rhythms
* **Play your Rhythm** - Discover your base rhythm - when you are high or low
* **Play it in a Group** - Discover your group rhythm – leader / follower/ contributor
* **Find Rhythm in Work & Life** - Discover the rhythms beyond the drums – in everything you do

**Workshop Size**: Up to 25 participants can be accomodated in the workshop. We will provide jembe and other percussion instructments during the workshop for the participants.

**Workshop Cost**: INR 25,000 for half-day session or INR 50,000 for full-day session (excluding GST). Travel and accomodation charges would be additional and on actuals.
