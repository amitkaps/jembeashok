# Jembe Course

Jembe means "Everyone gather together in peace". This course is to enable everyone to learn to play the Jembe - an African drum and use that as a medium to find the joy of playing together. This is typically held as a 16 session workshop for 2 hours each, held on the weekends. No prior musical background is necessary. And if you don't have a jembe, they would be provided for the workshop duration.
