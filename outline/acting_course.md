# Acting Course

This course is my humble effort to share 20 years of my acting experience across theatre, film and television. This is designed for upcoming actors who have some acting experience in these mediums and feel the need to further develop their skills. This will be held as an intensive workshop of about 15 sessions of 3 hours each, across two weeks. The number of actors will be restricted to 15 to ensure personalised attention can be provided. This will give each actor an opportunity to work on their specific areas of focus and improvement e.g. body language, voice and modulation, effective dialogue delivery etc.
